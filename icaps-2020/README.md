This repository constinas the domain and a example of the problem generated for 5 robots using the descentralised goal distribution in:

"A Decentralised Strategy for Heterogeneous AUV Missions via Goal Distribution and Temporal Planning"

1. dhrta folder contains the domain and problems  which were generated using the 
   Descentralised Heterogeneous Robots Task Allocator (DHRTA) algorithm presented in the paper.

   How to run it?
   
       --> Clone the repository
       --> Compile the planners:
       
                1) TFLAP & OPTIC IPC-2018 (https://ipc2018-temporal.bitbucket.io/)
       
           
                2) POPF (https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/planning/software/popf.html)
                
                
         --> Run the planners using the domain and problem required
